        Towering in shiny metallic purple armour<br>
        Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him<br>

        Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,<br>
        They quietly understand<br>
        Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,<br>
        But wonder why the fight is on<br>
        But they're all bold as love, yeah, they're all bold as love<br>
        Yeah, they're all bold as love<br>
        Just ask the axis<br>
        My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war<br>
        And ribbons of euphoria<br>
        Orange is young, full of daring,<br>
        But very unsteady for the first go round<br>
        My yellow in this case is not so mellow<br>
        In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me<br>
        And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, eh<br>
        Giving my life to a rainbow like you<br>
        But, I'm bold as love, yeah, I'm bold as love<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>
        Well I'm bold, bold as love (hear me talking, girl)<br>
        I'm bold as love<br>
        Just ask the axis (he knows everything)<br>

        I'm gon' get down in this connection, oh well, keep on tanglin' with these wires<br>
